## Title: British Airways Customer Booking Behaviour

**Overview:** Welcome to the British Airways Customer Booking Behaviour project! This project aims to analyze and predict customer booking behaviors to understand the factors influencing their decisions on wether to book the flight or not. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that can provide insights into customer preferences and predict future booking patterns. This analysis can help British Airways enhance their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize their services.

# Aim
Your task in this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts customer booking behaviors based on various factors such as demographics, travel history, and booking patterns. Accurate predictions can help British Airways tailor their services to meet customer needs, improve marketing strategies, and enhance customer experience.

# Importance of the Model
**Customer Insights:** Understanding customer booking behavior helps in identifying preferences and trends, allowing for more personalized services.
